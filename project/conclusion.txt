 Conclusion Report: Market Sentiment & Trade Behavior Analysis

 Objective:
 The objective of this assignment is :
To explore the relationship between trader performance and market sentiment using historical trading data and Fear & Greed Index sentiment scores.

 1. Data Preprocessing

- Trade Data (historical_data.csv)
  - Handled timestamp conversion from milliseconds to datetime.
  - Cleaned and converted numeric columns like Execution Price, Size USD, Fee, and Closed PnL.
  - Removed duplicate rows and handled missing values (if any).
  - Verified data types for compatibility with analysis tools.

- Sentiment Data (fear_greed_index.csv)
  - Converted UNIX timestamp (in seconds) to datetime format.
  - Grouped classification into categories like Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, and Extreme Greed.
  - Checked for imbalances in sentiment classes and standardized sentiment values.

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

- Trade Data Insights:
  - Distribution plots for Execution Price, Size USD, and Closed PnL revealed skewed behavior with outliers.
  - Strong concentration of trades with zero or negative PnL.
  - Clustering with KMeans on standardized trade metrics revealed distinct trade behavior segments.

- Sentiment Insights:
  - Time series plot shows the oscillation between greed and fear sentiment over time.
  - Boxplots and bar charts show how sentiment classifications relate to sentiment values.

- Merged Analysis:
  - Merged sentiment and trade data on timestamp for contextual analysis.
  - Found that larger trade sizes and high fees often occurred during "Greed" phases.
  - Volatility in Closed PnL also showed variation with sentiment phases.

 3. main Conclusion

- Trade Size & Sentiment:
  - Higher trade volumes and higher average fees tend to occur during "Greed" or "Extreme Greed" phases, suggesting more aggressive trading.

- PnL Behavior:
  - During "Fear" periods, most trades have near-zero or negative PnL, indicating lower market confidence and profitability.
